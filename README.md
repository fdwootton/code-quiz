# Coding Quiz

This application is a quiz to test your coding knowledge.  The quiz is made up of five questions. You are given 75 seconds to answer them.  If you choose an incorrect answer, you lose 10 seconds from your time. If you choose the correct answer, you are allowed to proceed to the next question.  Once you answer all the questions or the time runs out, you may input your initials to save your score.

#Project Status
The current version of the quiz is a work in progress. There are still a few bugs that need to be worked out. The high scores page does not present each new score on a new line. The multiple choice options are not shuffled.
